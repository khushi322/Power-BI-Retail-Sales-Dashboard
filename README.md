📊 Interactive Retail Sales Dashboard using Power BI
This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics project showcasing a sales dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI.

🎯 Project Overview
This project transforms raw retail sales data into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. It's designed to help business stakeholders quickly identify sales trends, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and discover actionable insights to improve profitability.

✨ Key Features
Executive KPIs: At-a-glance cards for Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Profit Margin.

Performance Analysis: Visuals for sales trends over time, profit by product category, and sales by geographic location.

Interactive Filtering: Slicers for Region and Order Date allow for dynamic, user-driven data exploration.

🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI Desktop: For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.

Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation (ETL).

DAX: To create calculated columns (Profit Margin, Shipping Duration).

🧼 Data Preparation
In Power Query, the data was cleaned by correcting data types (e.g., Postal Code to Text) and creating new DAX columns like Profit Margin and Shipping Duration to enrich the analysis.

💡 Key Insights
Profitability: The Technology category is a key profit driver, while Furniture (especially Tables) shows low profitability despite high sales.

Regional Performance: The West and East regions are the top markets by sales volume.

Seasonal Trends: Sales consistently peak in Q4, aligning with holiday seasons.
